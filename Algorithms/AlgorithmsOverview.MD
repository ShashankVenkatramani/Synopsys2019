# Done:
Heat Sensor input + display v1

# Not Done:
Algorithms to look into:
    - Heat sensor algorithms
        - Heat sensor input to processing
        - processed image prediction model
        - Processed image + prediction output to app 
    - Pathfinding
        - Input of GPS location
        - Going to that GPS Location w/ object avoidance so it doesn't crash into a tree
    - Automatic object avoidance
        - Input of image
        - Actual code to avoid object (?) -- need to look into
    - System management
        - GPS
            - Communication of GPS to main computing drone / power
            - Main computing drone / power
        - Communication of GPS coordinates
            - Radio comms
        - System vs individual control
            - Need to look at the output received from computing and what drones need to move
            - What drones need to drop payload
        - Drones changing behavior on environment
